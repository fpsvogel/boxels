# WIP platformer using only colored squares

> [!NOTE]
> This game is not yet fun to play. At this early stage I'm just messing around with DragonRuby.

## Play it on Itch.io

[fpsvogel.itch.io/boxels](https://fpsvogel.itch.io/boxels)

## Run it locally

Copy the contents of this repo into a fresh copy of [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk), then run `./dragonruby`.
